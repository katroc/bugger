## 3-Level Hierarchical Task Management

bugger-mcp introduces a revolutionary approach to project management with intelligent 3-level hierarchy:

### **Items ‚Üí Todos ‚Üí Subtasks**

**The Natural Workflow:**
1. **Create a Task** (Bug, Feature, or Improvement)
2. **Generate Actionable Todos** - AI analyzes your task and creates specific, actionable todo items
3. **Organize into Subtasks** - Todos are intelligently grouped into logical work phases

### **Smart Auto-Generation**

**Task-Specific Todo Generation:**
- **Bugs**: Investigation ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing workflow
- **Features**: Planning ‚Üí Frontend/Backend ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Documentation
- **Improvements**: Analysis ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation

**Intelligent Subtask Grouping:**
- **Bugs**: "Investigation and Analysis" ‚Üí "Implementation and Fix" ‚Üí "Testing and Validation"
- **Features**: "Planning and Design" ‚Üí "Frontend Implementation" ‚Üí "Backend Implementation" ‚Üí "Testing and Documentation"
- **Improvements**: "Analysis and Research" ‚Üí "Implementation" ‚Üí "Validation and Testing"

### **Example Workflow:**

```
1. Create Bug: "API performance issues with database queries"
   ‚Üì
2. Generate Todos:
   - "Reproduce the issue and gather details"
   - "Analyze logs and error messages"
   - "Profile performance and identify bottlenecks"
   - "Optimize slow queries or operations"
   - "Write regression tests"
   - "Test the fix in different scenarios"
   - "Verify the fix resolves the original issue"
   ‚Üì
3. Auto-Group into Subtasks:
   - "Investigation and Analysis" (todos 1-2)
   - "Implementation and Fix" (todos 3-4)
   - "Testing and Validation" (todos 5-7)
```

This approach creates a more natural and actionable project management experience where **todos are the atomic work units** and **subtasks are logical groupings** of related work.

## MCP Server Setup

### Claude Code

Add the following to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bugger": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "bugger-mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### WSL Configuration

For Windows users running WSL, use this configuration instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bugger": {
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "bugger-mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other IDEs

The configuration is similar for other MCP-compatible tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Continue.dev, and Zed. Use the same command (`npx`) and args (`["-y", "bugger-mcp@latest"]`) in their respective MCP configuration formats.

## Architecture

### Modular Design (v0.4.5+)

bugger-mcp features a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns into focused manager classes:

- **BugManager**: Handles all bug-related operations including creation, status updates, and validation
- **FeatureManager**: Manages feature requests with user stories, acceptance criteria, and effort estimation
- **ImprovementManager**: Tracks technical debt, code quality improvements, and optimization tasks
- **SearchManager**: Provides advanced search capabilities, filtering, and project statistics
- **ContextManager**: Manages code context collection, file references, and dependency tracking
- **WorkflowManager**: Orchestrates complex multi-step operations and item relationships
- **TodoManager**: Manages todo items with intelligent auto-generation from tasks and completion tracking
- **SubtaskManager**: Handles subtask creation, grouping todos into logical work phases, and progress tracking

This modular approach ensures better maintainability, easier testing, and cleaner separation of responsibilities while maintaining full backward compatibility. The new hierarchical workflow leverages these managers to create a natural Items ‚Üí Todos ‚Üí Subtasks progression.

### Storage Architecture

bugger-mcp uses SQLite for data storage, providing fast indexed searches, ACID transactions, and full-text search capabilities that scale well as projects grow. The single-file database approach offers the reliability and performance of a proper database without requiring server setup, while still supporting complex queries, relationships between items, and concurrent access from multiple AI assistant sessions.

## Database Location

The `bugger.db` file is created in your current working directory when you first use the MCP server. This means each project gets its own isolated tracking database, keeping your bugs, features, and improvements organized per project. You can backup, version control, or share the database file as needed - it's completely portable and self-contained.
